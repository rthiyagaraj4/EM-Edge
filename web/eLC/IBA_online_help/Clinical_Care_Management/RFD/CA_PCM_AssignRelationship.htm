	<li class=kadov-p-CNumberRFD><p class=NumberRFD><span class=UnderlineRFD>Limit 
 Practitioner List to Access Location</span> – Select the check box to 
 indicate that the list of practitioner names listed in the ‘Practitioner’ 
 field is restricted to the practitioners that have access to the location 
 of the patient. The location access is defined in ‘Location for Practitioner’ 
 master. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CNumberRFD><p class=NumberRFD><span class=UnderlineRFD>Practitioner

	<li class=kadov-p-CNumberRFD><p class=NumberRFD><span class=UnderlineRFD>Practitioner</span> 
 – Select the Practitioner Name for which the relationship has to be assigned. 
 The practitioner names correspond to the Practitioner Type chosen. Further 
 the practitioner name is listed based on the location access, if the ‘Limit 
 Practitioner List to Access Location’ check box is selected. In such a 
 case, the names of all the practitioners that have access to the location 
 in which the patient is currently hosted are displayed. If the ‘Limit 
 Practitioner List to Access Location’ check box is not selected, the names 
 of all the practitioners belonging to the selected Practitioner Type are 
 listed. </p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CNumberRFD><p class=NumberRFD><span class=UnderlineRFD>Relationship</span> 
 – Select the Relationship from the list. The relationships are defined 
 in the ‘Relationship’ function but the values listed in the list are filtered 
 based on the relationships associated with the logged in responsibility. 
 This is defined in the ‘Responsibility for Relationship’ function. This 
 field is mandatory.</p></li>
</ol>

 assign are based on the responsibility using which the practitioner has 
 logged in to Clinician’s Access. This is defined in the master ‘Relationship 
 for Responsibility’. The practitioner can assign only those relationships 
 that have the ‘Can Assign’ flag selected against the responsibility that 
 the practitioner uses to log in to Clinician’s Access. The system also 
 validates for the practitioner to whom the relationship is being assigned. 
 If the practitioner to whom the relationship is being assigned has the 
 ‘Can Hold’ flag selected against any of the responsibilities the practitioner 
 has been associated with, all such relationships can be assigned to the 
 practitioner.</p>
