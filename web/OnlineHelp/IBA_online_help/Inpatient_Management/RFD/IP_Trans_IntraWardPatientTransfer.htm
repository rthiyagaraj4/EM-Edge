If the bed class change was due to the request of the patient, all the charges for the patient are recalculated based on the new billing group associated with the bed class selected. If the bed class change was due to a request from the facility, the user doing the confirmation must authorize the bed class change by providing a Username and pin as defined in System Manager. If the privilege level of the bed class is lesser than the privilege level associated to the patient, by virtue of the billing group associated to the patient, this authorization is not required and hence this window does not pop up.</p>
