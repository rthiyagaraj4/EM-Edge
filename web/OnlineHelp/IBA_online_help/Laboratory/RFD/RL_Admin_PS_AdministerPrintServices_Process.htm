<p class="BoldRFD">Enter the details in the Administer Tab:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Process</span> – The Process displays a list of active print services.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Facility ID</span> - The processes which are defined as multiple instances, for those processes facility can be entered by selecting individual facility from list or '*ALL' for all facilities. This field is disabled, if the selected process is of single instance. If single facility is selected, server process processes the request for that facility only. If '*ALL' is selected, the server process processes the request for all facilities. You cannot restart the process, if it has been started for a single facility. Similarly, if process has started for all facilities, it cannot be restarted for a single facility.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Priority</span> - The process which are defined as multiple instances, for those processes priority can be entered by selecting individual priority from list box or '*ALL' for all priorities. This field is disabled if the selected process is of single instance. If single priority is selected, server process will process the request for the respective priority. If '*ALL' is selected, the server process processes the request for all priorities. Once the process has started for a single priority, it cannot be started for all the priorities. Similarly, if process has started for all the priorities, it cannot be started for single priority.</p>

Currently two services named 'Lab Result Reporting' and 'Patient Bill Printing' are available for selection. Select '*ALL' to process print requests generated from both processes. This field is disabled for other processes. If Lab Result Reporting' service is selected, the 'Print Services' process prints the requests created by 'Lab Result Reporting' based on the priorities defined. If 'Patient Bill Printing' service is selected, the 'Print Services' process prints the requests created by 'Patient Bill Printing' process.</p>
