<h1>Print Routing</h1>
<p class="Italic">From this function you can <span class="RedItalic">Create</span> a new Print Routing rule and <span class="RedItalic">Query</span> for a desired Print Routing rule.</p>
<p class="Text">For certain reports, printing have to be performed based on the print routing rules setup. For example, in a facility, visit registration is performed in the general registration desk, maternity clinic and pediatrics clinic. In this scenario, the visit label generated at the end of visit registration function should be printed in the label printer of maternity clinic for all registration performed in that clinic; in the label printer of pediatrics clinic for all registrations performed in that clinic; in the label printer of the registration desk for registrations of all other clinics. For achieving this requirement, print routing rule records are to be set up; so that, during visit registration, the printer to which the label has to be routed is derived dynamically based on the clinic from which it is generated and the output is spooled to that printer.</p>
<p class="Text">Sometimes, the print routing rules are to be defined based on the workstation identifier of the client, which runs Enterprise Management. For example, in a facility, patient registration is performed from two different locations, say, a male desk and a female desk. If the patient label generated at the male registration desk has to be printed in the label printer located in the male registration area and the patient label generated at the female registration desk has to be printed in the label printer located in the female registration area, only way to achieve this is by setting up work station based print routing rules. In this case, it is possible to identify the clients at the registration desks by their unique identity and the rules are set up to route the patient label to appropriate printers based on their unique identity.</p>
<p class="Text"><span class="BoldButton">The following types of print routing rules can be set up using this function:</span></p>
<p class="Text" style="margin-left: 40px;">• For any non-transaction based report, report can be generated and routed to specific printer. Optionally, reports could be routed based on the workstations that generate them.</p>
<p class="Text" style="margin-left: 40px;">• For any transaction based report, report can be generated and routed to a specific printer based on the clinic/nursing unit/department from where the transaction is performed. Optionally, reports could be routed based on the workstations that generate them.</p>
<p class="Text" style="margin-left: 40px;">• If the report is facility based, the rules are to be set up at the level of facility.</p>
<p class="Text" style="margin-left: 40px;">• As part of every print routing rule record, the printer to which the output has to be routed, number of copies to be printed and the report mode in which the output has to be generated are set up. Report mode can be used to select the mode of output generation depending on the printer to which it is routed to, if Enterprise Management supports both character and bit mapped report programs for a report. Current, the product ships all reports only in bit-mapped format.</p>
<p class="Text"><span class="BoldButton">For achieving workstation based print routing, the following points should be noted while setting up IP addresses of the clients while setting up the environment for using Enterprise Management:</span></p>
<p class="Text">In case static IP addresses are used in the network, it is mandatory that the IP addresses be to be allocated as unique across all locations of the enterprise implementing the product.</p>
<p class="Text">In case DHCP is used instead of allocating static IP addresses to clients, it is mandatory either to allocate static IP address for all the clients from which workstation based routing of outputs are required or to map static IP addresses against the MAC addresses of such clients in the DHCP server.</p>
