<p class=BoldRFD>Enter the following criteria to print the count sheet:</p>

<ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CNumberRFD><p class=NumberRFD><span class=UnderlineRFD>Physical 
 Inv Process Mode</span> – Select the required value for the mode from 
 the list. The list values are ‘Annual’ and 'Perpetual’. The value ‘Annual’ 
 is displayed, by default. All the fields except Store Code is disabled, 
 if ‘Physical Inv Process Mode’ is selected as ‘Annual’.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CNumberRFD><p class=NumberRFD><span class=UnderlineRFD>Store 
 Code [From-To]</span> - Enter the Store Codes range for which the count 
 sheets are to be generated in alphanumeric format of six characters maximum 
 length and select the Store Codes using <span class=BoldNumberRFD>[?]</span> 
 function. The values are optional. If ‘From’ value is not entered, the 
 system assumes a low value for the ‘From’ selected Store Code and if ‘To’ 
 value is not entered, the system assumes a high value for the ‘To’ Store 
 Code. When both values are entered, ‘To’ value has to be greater than 
 or equal to the ‘From’ value. </p></li>

 Code [From-To]</span> - This field is enabled when the Physical Inv Process 
 mode is selected as ‘Perpetual’ or on selection of ‘Annual’ this field 
 is disabled. Enter the Item Codes range for which the count sheet is to 
 be generated in alphanumeric format of 20 characters maximum length or 
 select the Item Code using <span class=BoldNumberRFD>[?]</span> function. 
 The values are optional. If ‘From’ value is not entered, the system assumes 
 a low value for the ‘From’ selected item code and if ‘To’ value is not 
 entered, the system assumes a high value for the ‘To’ item code. When 
 both values are entered, ‘To’ value has to be greater than or equal to 
 the ‘From’ value. </p></li>

 Class [From-To]</span> - This field is enabled when the Physical Inv Process 
 Mode is selected as ‘Perpetual’ or on selection of ‘Annual’ this field 
 is disabled. Enter the Item Class range for which the count sheet is to 
 be generated in alphanumeric format of four characters maximum length 
 or select the Item Class using <span class=BoldNumberRFD>[?]</span> function. 
 The values are optional. If ‘From’ value is not entered, the system assumes 
 a low value for the ‘From’ selected Item Class code and if ‘To’ value 
 is not entered, the system assumes a high value for the ‘To’ Item Class 
 code. When both values are entered, ‘To’ value should be greater than

 is disabled. Enter the alpha codes range for which the count sheet is 
 to be generated in alphanumeric format of 10 characters maximum length 
 or select the Alpha Code using the <span class=BoldNumberRFD>[?]</span> 
 function. The values are optional. If ‘From’ value is not entered, the 
 system assumes a low value for the ‘From’ selected Alpha Code and if ‘To’ 
 value is not entered, the system assumes a high value for the ‘To’ Alpha 
 Code. When both values are entered, ‘To’ value should be greater than 
 or equal to the ‘From’ value. </p></li>

 Process Mode is selected as ‘Perpetual’ or on selection of ‘Annual’, this 
 field is disabled. Enter the Unit Cost range for which the count sheet 
 is to be generated in numeric format of 15 digits maximum length. The 
 values are optional. If ‘From’ value is not entered, the system assumes 
 a low value for the ‘From’ selected Unit Cost and if ‘To’ value is not 
 entered, the system assumes a high value for the ‘To’ Unit Cost. When 
 both values are entered, ‘To’ value should be greater than or equal to 
 the ‘From’ value.</p></li>
