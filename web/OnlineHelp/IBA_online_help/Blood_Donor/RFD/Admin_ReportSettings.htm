<p class="BoldRFD">Facility Based Report Parameters</p>
<ol>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Module Name</span> – Click <span class="BoldNumberRFD">[List of Values]</span> to select the desired Module Name. &#160;</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Report Desc</span> – Click <span class="BoldNumberRFD">[List of Values]</span> to select the appropriate Report Description.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Facility Name</span> - Click <span class="BoldNumberRFD">[List of Values]</span> to select the applicable Facility Name.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Report Group</span> – Select the desired Report Group from list.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="BoldRFD">&#160;</p>
<p class="BoldRFD">Report Settings</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">You can view the reports defined in the respective module by clicking <span class="BoldNumberRFD">[Execute Query]</span> or pressing <span class="BoldNumberRFD">[F8]</span>.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Module</span> – The Module ID in which the report is defined is displayed. You cannot update the values in the field.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Report ID</span> – The Report ID for the respective module gets displayed. You cannot update the values in the field.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Report Class</span> – There are two report classes namely, ‘Report’ and ‘Label’ are supported. The values are displayed based on the value selected.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Default Report Mode</span> – When the report is developed, the mode is fixed as either Bitmap or Character. Normally, 132 column reports are generated in character mode and other reports are developed in bitmapped mode. While dot matrix printers support character reports, rest of the printers support both character and bitmapped reports. It is possible to package both bitmapped and character, report programs for the same report, so that, the system administrator can select either of these modes, in the current version of the product. The report program of any report is supplied in only one mode and hence, this parameter has no effect currently.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Next three parameters are applicable for the bitmapped and character reports:</p>
<ol start="9">
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Report Tool</span> – The tool using which the report is developed gets displayed. Different tools like Report Writer (R), PRO*C (C), Java (J), PL/SQL and so on are used for development.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Executable</span> – The name of the report program executable gets displayed. Based on the Report ID, the executable ID is populated during execution to run the required report program.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Default File Format</span> – This parameter is applicable only when ‘Generate File’ parameter is set to ‘Yes’. When a report has to be generated as a file, the format in which the file is to be generated is defaulted as set up in this parameter, which can be changed at run time. The default file format for bitmapped/character mode reports for which the output file is generated at run time can be set to one of the values given below:</p>
</li>
<li class="p-BulletRFD">
<p class="BulletRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">For Bitmapped Reports:</span> ‘H’ – HTML; ‘P’ – PDF; ‘R’ – RTF (Character); ‘X’ – XML; ‘D’ – DELIMITED.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-BulletRFD">
<p class="BulletRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">For Character Reports:</span> ‘A’ – ASCII, ‘D’ - DELIMITED, for report writer based programs and ‘A’ for non-report writer based programs.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Report Group ID</span> – Click <span class="BoldNumberRFD">[List of Values]</span> to select the desired value. The values are system-defined.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Application Routing</span> - Select the value from the list. The listed values are Print, Fax, Mail and None.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Status Change Allowed?</span> - If the check box is selected, the status of the Transaction Based field can be changed from transaction based to non-transaction based or vice-versa. When the check box is selected, the application user is permitted to change the value of the ‘Transaction Based’ property appropriately to suit the requirement for a particular installation. If the check box is cleared, the Transaction Based field cannot be changed.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Internal Request?</span> – Select the check box to set up the print routing rules based on the internal request.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Transaction Based?</span> – Print routing rules of some of the outputs can be set up based on the location from which the outputs are generated. Example: An outpatient clinic or an inpatient ward, etc. If the check box is selected, it is possible to set up the rules based on the location. If the check box is cleared, it is not possible to set up the rules based on the location. It is a preset value and normally set as selected for certain online reports. The administrator can select or clear the check box, only when ‘Status Change Allowed’ is set as selected.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Facility Based?</span> – For some of the reports, facility based parameters or routing rules are to be set up. This especially happens when the facilities are distinctly identifiable physical locations and distributed. Most of the reports pertaining to a facility could be classified as facility based reports and other reports pertaining to an enterprise are to be classified other way. If a report is transaction based, it is always a facility-based report. Otherwise, you can clear the check box. &#160;</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Generate File</span> – The check box is selected, by default. You cannot clear the check box. This parameter indicates whether the report can be generated as a file or not.</p>
</li>
