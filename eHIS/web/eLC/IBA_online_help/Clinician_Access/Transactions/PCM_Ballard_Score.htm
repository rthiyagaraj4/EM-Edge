<h1>Ballard Score</h1>

<p class="Text">This function allows to record and print the Ballard score for all age groups.</p>
<p class="Text">The New Ballard Score is a set of procedures developed to determine Gestational Age through neuromuscular and physical assessment of a newborn infant. It is intended to provide detailed information on gestational age assessment, specifically focused on the New Ballard Score. It has been classified into two components:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="p-Text">
<p class="Text">Neuromuscular Maturity – Its sub components are: 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a1">Posture</a>, 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a2">Square Window (Wrist)</a>, 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a3">Arm Recoil</a>, 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a4">Popliteal angle</a>, 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a5">Scarf Sign</a>, 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a6">Heel to Ear</a></p>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP349613161" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">This maneuver measures passive flexor tone about the pelvic girdle by testing for passive flexion or resistance to extension of posterior hip flexor muscles.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">The infant is placed supine and the flexed lower extremity is brought to rest on the mattress alongside the infant's trunk.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">The examiner supports the infant's thigh laterally alongside the body with the palm of one hand. The other hand is used to grasp the infant's foot at the sides and to pull it toward the ipsilateral ear.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">The examiner fells for resistance to extension of the posterior pelvic girdle flexors and notes the location of the heel where significant resistance is appreciated. Landmarks noted in order of increasing maturity include resistance felt when the heel is at or near the: ear (-1); nose (0); chin level (1); nipple line (2); umbilical area (3); and femoral crease (4).</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP350562113" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">This maneuver tests the passive tone of the flexors about the shoulder girdle.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">With the infant lying supine, the examiner adjusts the infant's head to the midline and supports the infant's hand across the upper chest with one hand. the thumb of the examiner's other hand is placed on the infant's elbow.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">The examiner nudges the elbow across the chest, felling for passive flexion or resistance to extension of posterior shoulder girdle flexor muscles.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">The point on the chest to which the elbow moves easily prior to significant resistance is noted. Landmarks noted in order of increasing maturity are: full scarf at the level of the neck (-1); contralateral axillary line (0); contralateral nipple line (1); xyphoid process (2); ipsilateral nipple line (3); and ipsilateral axillary line (4).</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP354312646" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">This maneuver assesses maturation of passive flexor tone about the knee joint by testing for resistance to extension of the lower extremity. With the infant lying supine, and with diaper re-moved, the thigh is placed gently on the infant's abdomen with the knee fully flexed. After the infant has relaxed into this position, the examiner gently grasps the foot at the sides with one hand while supporting the side of the thigh with the other. Care is taken not to exert pressure on the hamstrings, as this may interfere with their function. The leg is extended until a definite resistance to extension is appreciated. In some infants, hamstring contraction may be visualized during this maneuver. At this point the angle formed at the knee by the upper and lower leg is measured.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Note: a) It is important that the examiner wait until the infant stops kicking actively before extending the leg. b) The prenatal frank breech position will interfere with this maneuver for the first 24 to 48 hours of age due to prolonged intrauterine flexor fatigue. The test should be repeated once recovery has occurred; alternately, a score similar to those obtained for other items in the exam may be assigned.</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP351868693" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">This maneuver focuses on passive flexor tone of the biceps muscle by measuring the angle of recoil following very brief extension of the upper extremity.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">With the infant lying supine, the examiner places one hand beneath the infant's elbow for support. Taking the infant's hand, the examiner briefly sets the elbow in flexion, then momentarily extends the arm before releasing the hand. The angle of recoil to which the forearm springs back into flexion is noted, and the appropriate square is selected on the score sheet. The extremely pre-term infant will not exhibit any arm recoil. Square #4 is selected only if there is contact between the infant's fist and face.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">This is seen in term and post term infants.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Care must be taken not to hold the arm in the extended position for a prolonged period, as this causes flexor fatigue and results in a falsely low score due to poor flexor recoil.</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP242390944" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Wrist flexibility and/or resistance to extensor stretching are responsible for the resulting angle of flexion at the wrist.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">The examiner straightens the infant's fingers and applies gentle pressure on the dorsum of the hand, close to the fingers. From extremely pre-term to post-term, the resulting angle between the palm of the infant's hand and forearm is estimated at;&gt;90°, 90°, 60°, 45°, 30°, and 0°.</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP351627447" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Total body muscle tone is reflected in the infant's preferred posture at rest and resistance to stretch of individual muscle groups. As maturation progresses, the fetus gradually assumes increasing passive flexor tone that proceeds in a centripetal direction, with lower extremities slightly ahead of upper extremities. For example, very early in gestation only the ankles are flexed. Knees will flex as wrists just begin to flex. Hip flexion, then adduction is just ahead of elbow, then shoulder girdle flexion. The preterm infant primarily exhibits unopposed passive extensor tone, while the infant approaching term shows progressively less opposed passive flexor tone.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">To elicit the posture item, the infant is placed supine (if found prone) and the examiner waits until the infant settles into a relaxed or preferred posture. If the infant is found supine, gentle manipulation (flex if extended; extend if flexed) of the extremities will allow the infant to seek the baseline position of comfort. Hip flexion without adduction results in the frog-leg position as depicted in posture square #3. Hip adduction accompanying flexion is depicted by the acute angle at the hips in posture square #4. The figure that most closely depicts the infant's preferred posture is selected.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="p-Text">
<p class="Text">Physical Maturity - &#160;Its sub components are: 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a7">Skin</a>, 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a8">Lanugo,</a> 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a9">Plantar Surface</a>, 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a10">Breast</a>, 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a11">Eye/Ear</a>, 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a12">Genitals (Male),</a> 
<a class="dropspot" href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" style="position: relative;" id="a13">Genitals (Female)</a></p>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP348757528" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">To examine the infant female, the hips should be only partially abducted, i.e., to approximately 45° from the horizontal with the infant lying supine. Exaggerated abduction may cause the clitoris and labia minora to appear more prominent, whereas adduction may cause the labia majora to cover over them.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">In extreme prematurity, the labia are flat and the clitoris is very prominent and may resemble the male phallus. As maturation progresses, the clitoris becomes less prominent and labia minora become more prominent. Nearing term, both clitoris and labia minora recede and are eventually enveloped by the enlarging labia majora.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">The labia majora contain fat and their sizes are affected by intrauterine nutrition. Over-nutrition may result in large labia majora earlier in gestation, whereas under-nutrition, as in intrauterine growth retardation or post-maturity, may result in small labia majora with relatively prominent clitoris and labia minora late into gestation. These findings should be reported as observed, since a lower score on this item in the chronically stressed or growth retarded fetus may be counter-balanced by a higher score on certain neuro-muscular items.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Based on the selection of images pertaining to subcomponents of component it will be assigned to a score &amp; derives it to total score.</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP351199275" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">The fetal testicles begin their descent from the peritoneal cavity into the scrotal sack at approximately the 30th week of gestation. The left testicle precedes the right and usually enters the scrotum during the 32nd week. Both testicles are usually palpable in the upper to lower inguinal canals by the end of the 33rd to 34th weeks of gestation. Concurrently, the scrotal skin thickens and develops deeper and more numerous rugae.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Testicles found inside the rugated zone are considered descended. In extreme prematurity the scrotum is flat, smooth and appears sexually undifferentiated. At term to post-term, the scrotum may become pendulous and may actually touch the mattress when the infant lies supine. Note: In true cryptorchidism, the scrotum on the affected side appears uninhabited, hypoplastic and with underdeveloped rugae compared to the normal side, or, for a given gestation, when bilateral. In such a case, the normal side should be scored, or if bilateral, a score similar to that obtained for the other maturational criteria should be assigned.</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP349942251" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">The pinna of the fetal ear changes it configuration and increases in cartilage content as maturation progresses. Assessment includes palpation for cartilage thickness, then folding the pinna forward toward the face and releasing it. The examiner notes the rapidity with which the folded pinna snaps back away from the face when released, then selects the square that most closely describes the degree of cartilaginous development.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">In very premature infants, the pinnae may remain folded when released. In such infants, the examiner notes the state of eyelid development as an additional indicator of fetal maturation. (ref 13) The examiner places thumb and forefinger on the upper and lower lids, gently moving them apart to separate them. The extremely immature infant will have tightly fused eyelids, i.e., the examiner will not be able to separate either palpebral fissure with gentle traction. The slightly more mature infant will have one or both eyelids fused but one or both will be partly separable by the light traction of the examiner's fingertips. these findings will allow the examiner to select on the score sheet a minus two (-2) for slightly fused, or minus one (-1) for loosely or partially fused eyelids. The examiner should not be surprised to find a wide variation in eyelid fusion status in individual infants at a given gestational age, as the rate of eyelid un-fusion may be affected by certain stress-related intrauterine and humoral factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP349891361" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">The breast bud consists of breast tissue that is stimulated to grow by maternal estrogens and fatty tissue which is dependent upon fetal nutritional status. the examiner notes the size of the areola and the presence or absence of stippling (created by the developing papillae of Montgomery). The examiner then palpates the breast tissue beneath the skin by holding it between thumb and forefinger, estimating its diameter in millimeters, and selects the appropriate square on the score sheet.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Under- and over-nutrition of the fetus may affect breast size variation at a given gestation. Maternal estrogen effect may produce neonatal gynecomastia on the second to fourth day of extrauterine life.</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP355058999" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">This item pertains to the major foot creases on the sole of the foot. The first appearance of a crease appears on the anterior sole at the ball of the foot. this may be related to foot flexion in utero, but is contributed to by dehydration of the skin. Infants of non-white origin have been reported to have fewer foot creases at birth. There is no known explanation for this.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">On the other hand, the reported acceleration of neuromuscular maturity in African American infants usually compensates for this, resulting in a cancellation of the delayed foot crease effect. Hence, there is usually no over- or under-estimation of gestational age due to race when the total score is performed.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Very premature and extremely immature infants have no detectable foot creases. To further help define the gestational age of these infants, measuring the foot length or heel-toe distance is helpful. This is done by placing the infant's foot on a metric tape measure and noting the distance from the back of the heel to the tip of the great toe. For heel-toe distances less than 40 mm, a minus two score (-2) is assigned; for those between 40 and 50 mm, a minus one score (-1) is assigned.</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP355045066" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Lanugo is the fine hair covering the body of the fetus.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">In extreme immaturity, the skin lacks any lanugo. It begins to appear at approximately the 24th to 25th week and is usually abundant, especially across the shoulders and upper back, by the 28th week of gestation.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Thinning occurs first over the lower back, wearing away as the fetal body curves forward into its mature, flexed position. Bald areas appear and become larger over the lumbo-sacral area. At term, most of the fetal back is devoid of lanugo, i.e., the back is mostly bald.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Variability in amount and location of lanugo at a given gestational age may be attributed in part to familial or national traits and to certain hormonal, metabolic, and nutritional influences. For example, infants of diabetic mothers characteristically have abundant lanugo on their pinnae and upper back until close to or beyond full-term gestation. When scoring for lanugo, the examiner selects the square that most closely describes the relative amounts of lanugo on the upper and lower areas of the infant's back.</p>
</div>
<div class="droptext" id="POPUP353308535" style="display: none;">
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Maturation of fetal skin involves the development of its intrinsic structures concurrent with the gradual loss of its protective coating, the vernix caseosa. Hence, it thickens, dries and becomes wrinkled and/or peels, and may develop a rash as fetal maturation progresses. These phenomena may occur at varying paces in individual fetuses depending in part upon the maternal condition and the intrauterine environment.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">Before the development of the epidermis with its stratum corneum, the skin is transparent and adheres somewhat to the examiner's finger. Later it smoothes, thickens and produces a lubricant, the vernix, that dissipates toward the end of gestation.</p>
<p class="BoldRFD" style="font-weight: normal;">At term and post-term, the fetus may expel meconium into the amniotic fluid. This may add an accelerating effect to the drying process, causing peeling, cracking, dehydration, and imparting a parchment, then leathery, appearance to the skin. For scoring purposes, the square which describes the infant's skin the most closely should be selected.</p>
