<h1>Birth Control</h1>

<p class=Text>Birth control, also known as contraception, is designed to 
 prevent pregnancy. Birth control methods may work in a number of different 
 ways. These include</p>

<p class=Text>- Blocking sperm from getting to the eggs - condoms and diaphragms 
 work this way.</p>

<p class=Text>- Keeping the woman's ovaries from releasing eggs that could 
 be fertilized - birth control pills work this way.</p>

<p class=Text>- Preventing fertilized egg from attaching to the lining 
 of the uterus - intrauterine devices (IUDs) work this way.</p>

<p class=Text>- Sterilization, which permanently prevents a woman from 
 getting pregnant or a man from being able to get a woman pregnant.</p>

<p class=Text>The Birth Control event is applicable to males as well as 
 females.</p>
