<h1>Setup Service Coverage Detail by Policy</h1>

<p class="Text">The function Setup Service Coverage Detail By Policy is used to set up the coverage details for a relevant Policy Type. The Coverage Limit and the Payment Basis are defined and associated to a relevant Patient Class.

The Coverage rule and the coverage percentage is applicable for the services and the material items associated for a selected Payer in a Payer Group and linked to a particular Policy Type. You have an option to include or exclude the material items and define the coverage limit amount for an Outpatient or an Inpatient limit type. Default material item criteria are defined. You can override the inclusion or exclusion of unspecified services by selecting or clearing the relevant check box.</p>
