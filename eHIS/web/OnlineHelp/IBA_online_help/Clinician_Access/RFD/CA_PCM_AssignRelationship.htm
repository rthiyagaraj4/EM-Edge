	 to indicate that the list of practitioner names listed in the ‘Practitioner’ 
	 field is restricted to the practitioners that have access to the location 
	 of the patient. The location access is defined in ‘Location for Practitioner’ 
	 master.</p></li>

	 the relationship. The list has values as defined in the ‘Practitioner 
	 Type’ master in Application Masters module.</p></li>
	<li class="p-NumberRFD"><p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Practitioner</span> 
	 – Select the Practitioner Name for which the relationship has to be 
	 assigned. The practitioner names correspond to the Practitioner Type 
	 chosen. Further the practitioner name is listed based on the location 
	 access, if the ‘Limit Practitioner List to Access Location’ check 
	 box is selected. In such a case, the names of all the practitioners

<p class="Note"><img src="../../Note.jpg" alt="Note.jpg" style="border: none;" width="39" height="26" border="0" />The relationships 
 that a logged in user can assign are based on the responsibility using 
 which the practitioner has logged in to Clinician’s Access. This is defined 
 in the master ‘Relationship for Responsibility’. The practitioner can 
 assign only those relationships that have the ‘Can Assign’ flag selected 
 against the responsibility that the practitioner uses to log in to Clinician’s 
 Access. The system also validates for the practitioner to whom the relationship 
 is being assigned. If the practitioner to whom the relationship is being 
 assigned has the ‘Can Hold’ flag selected against any of the responsibilities 
 the practitioner has been associated with, all such relationships can 
 be assigned to the practitioner.</p>
