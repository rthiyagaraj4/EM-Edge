<h1>Report Settings</h1>
<p class="BoldRFD">You can update only the selected parameters in the report settings:</p>
<p class="BoldRFD">&#160;</p>
<ol>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Module</span> – The codes for the modules associated with the Facility are displayed. The data in the field is not editable on committing.,</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Report ID</span> – The Report ID is populated automatically. The values are system defined.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Report Class</span> – Currently, two report classes are defined, namely, ‘Report’ and ‘Label’. Report Class for the respective module is set. The data in the field is not editable.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Description</span> – When the report is developed, the mode is fixed either as bitmap or character. Normally, 132 column reports are generated in character mode and other reports are developed in bitmapped mode. While dot matrix printers support character reports, rest of the printers support both character and bitmapped reports. It is possible to package both bitmapped and character report programs for the same report, so that the system administrator can select either of these modes. In the current version of the product, the report program is supplied in only one mode and hence, this parameter has no effect currently.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Generate File</span> – This parameter indicates whether the report can be generated as a file or not. The data in the field is not editable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="Note"><img src="../../Note.jpg" style="border: none;" alt="Note.jpg" width="39" height="26" border="0" />You can update the Report Tool, Executable and the Default File Format for the bitmapped and character reports.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Report Tool</span> – The Report Tool identifies the tool using which the report is developed. Different tools like Report Writer (R), PRO*C (C), Java (J), etc. can be used for development. This field is not editable.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Executable</span> – The name of the report program executable is displayed. Based on the Report ID, this name is picked up during execution to run the required report program. This field is not editable.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Default File Format</span> – The parameter is applicable only when ‘Generate File’ parameter is set to ‘Yes’. When a report has to be generated as a file, the format in which the file is to be generated is defaulted as set up in this parameter, which can be changed at run time. The default file format for bitmapped/character mode reports for which the output file is generated at run time can be set to one of the values given below:</p>
</li>
<li class="p-BulletRFD">
<p class="BulletRFD">For bitmapped reports - ‘H’ – HTML; ‘P’ – PDF; ‘R’ – RTF (Character); ‘X’ – XML; ‘D’ – DELIMITED.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-BulletRFD">
<p class="BulletRFD">For character reports - ‘A’ – ASCII, ‘D’ - DELIMITED, for report writer based programs and ‘A’ for non-report writer based programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Online Report</span> – At the end of a transaction, for example, Patient Registration, certain set of outputs are generated automatically without the end user requesting for the same, like, Patient Label, Front Sheet, File Label. These reports, which are invoked automatically by the system and cannot be invoked by the end user, are classified as Online Report. This flag cannot be changed.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Internal Request</span> - If the check box is selected, the Report can be based on Internal Request. If the check box is cleared, the report is not based on Internal Request.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Status Change Allowed</span> - If the check box is selected, the status of the Transaction Based field can be changed from transaction based to non-transaction based or vice-versa. When the check box is selected, the application user is permitted to change the value of the ‘Transaction Based’ property appropriately to suite the requirement for a particular installation. If the check box is cleared, the Transaction Based field cannot be changed.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Transaction Based</span> – Print routing rules of some of the outputs can be set up based on the location from which the outputs are generated, for example, an outpatient clinic or an inpatient ward. When the check box is selected, it is possible to set up the rules based on the location. When the check box is cleared, it is not possible to set up the rules based on the location. It is a preset value and normally set as checked for certain online reports. The administrator can change it, only when ‘Status Change Allowed’ is set as selected.</p>
</li>
<li class="p-NumberRFD">
<p class="NumberRFD"><span class="UnderlineRFD">Facility Based</span> – Print routing rules of some of the outputs can be set up based on the facility from which the outputs are generated, for example, an outpatient clinic or an inpatient ward. When the check box is selected, it is possible to set up the rules based on the facility. When the check box is cleared, it is not possible to set up the rules based on the facility. It is a preset value and normally set as selected for certain online reports. The administrator can change it, only when ‘Status Change Allowed’ is set as selected.</p>
